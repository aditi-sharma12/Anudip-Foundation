# 2. Python Program to Find the Largest Among Three Numbers

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = int(input("Enter the third number: "))
if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:
    largest = num1
elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:
    largest = num2
else:

# 3. Python Program to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative or 0.

# 4. A toy vendor supplies three types of toys: Battery Based Toys, Key-based Toys, and Electrical Charging Based Toys. The vendor gives a discount of 10% on orders for battery-based toys if the order is for more than Rs. 1000. On orders of more than Rs. 100 for key-based toys, a discount of 5% is given, and a discount of 10% is given on orders for electrical charging based toys of value more than Rs. 500. Assume that the numeric codes 1,2 and 3 are used for battery based toys, key-based toys, and electrical charging based toys respectively. Write a program that reads the product code and the order amount and prints out the net amount that the customer is required to pay after the discount.

order_amount_1 = int(input("Enter the order amount for product code 1: "))
order_amount_2 = int(input("Enter the order amount for product code 2: "))
order_amount_3 = int(input("Enter the order amount for product code 3: "))
# total_orders = {1: order_amount_1, 2: order_amount_2, 3: order_amount_3}
sum = order_amount_1 + order_amount_2 + order_amount_3
print("Your total order amount is: ", sum)
if sum > 1000:
    print("You got 10% discount on your order for battery based toys")
    order_amount_1 -= order_amount_1 * 0.1
if sum > 100:
    print("You got 5% discount on your order for key based toys")
    order_amount_2 -= order_amount_2 * 0.05
if sum > 500:

    order_amount_3 -= order_amount_3 * 0.1
    
sum = order_amount_1 + order_amount_2 + order_amount_3
print("Your total order amount is: ", sum)

# 5. A transport company charges the fare according to following table:

# 7. Write a python program to check whether a number is palindrome or not?

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
while num > 0:
    factorial *= num
    num -= 1
print("Factorial:", factorial)

# 9. Accept numbers using input() function until the user enters 0. If user input 0 then break the while loop and display the sum of all the numbers.

sum = 0
while True:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    if num == 0:
        break
    sum += num
print("Sum of all the numbers:", sum)

# 10. Print the first 10 natural numbers using for loop

for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)

# 11. Python program to check if the given string is a palindrome

string = input("Enter a string: ")
if string == string[::-1]:
    print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
