Assignment:

# 1. Write a Python program to handle a ZeroDivisionError exception when dividing a number by zero.

try:
    a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    b = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    c = a/b
    print(c)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    
    print("Cannot divide by zero")

# 2. Write a Python program that prompts the user to input an integer and raises a ValueError exception if the input is not a valid integer.

try:
    a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print("You entered:", a)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")

# 3. Write a Python program that opens a file and handles a FileNotFoundError exception if the file does not exist.

try:
    f=open("file.txt","r")
    f.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")

# 4. Write a Python program that prompts the user to input two numbers and raises a TypeError exception if the inputs are not numerical.

try:
    a = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter another number: "))
    print("You entered:", a, " and ", b)
except ValueError:
    print("Inputs are not numerical")
