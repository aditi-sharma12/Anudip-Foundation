#* CHATGPT EXERCISE

#! Scenario:Analyzing Sales Data Suppose you work for a retail company, and you have dummy data containing sales data for the past year. The data includes information such as SalesDate,product names,regions, sales quantities, prices, and dates. You have to generate a bar chart ,pie plot on region and prices and line chart on SalesDate and prices columns. Further, you need to get some inference out of the chart. Create a ChatGPT prompt to generate the code for this scenario. Based on the code generated, ask ChatGPT to give the conclusion/inference. Note. You can provide the data to ChatGPT or ask it to use sample data.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = {
    'SalesDate': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=100, freq='D'),
    'ProductName': np.random.choice(['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C'], 100),
    'Region': np.random.choice(['North', 'South', 'East', 'West'], 100),
    'SalesQuantity': np.random.randint(1, 20, 100),
    'Price': np.random.uniform(10, 100, 100)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Bar chart: Total Sales Quantity by Region
sales_by_region = df.groupby('Region')['SalesQuantity'].sum()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sales_by_region.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title('Total Sales Quantity by Region')
plt.xlabel('Region')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales Quantity')
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.show()

# Pie chart: Distribution of Total Sales by Region
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
sales_by_region.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=['#ff9999','#66b3ff','#99ff99','#ffcc99'])
plt.title('Distribution of Total Sales by Region')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()

# Line chart: Trend of Average Prices Over Time
df['SalesDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['SalesDate'])
avg_price_by_date = df.groupby('SalesDate')['Price'].mean()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
avg_price_by_date.plot(kind='line', marker='o', color='green')
plt.title('Trend of Average Prices Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Average Price')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()


#! Conclusion:-
# Bar Chart: Total Sales Quantity by Region
'''
North Region Dominance: The North region has the highest total sales quantity, indicating strong market presence and customer demand. This suggests that the North region could be a critical area for the company's business, possibly due to factors like higher population density, better distribution networks, or successful marketing strategies.
East Region's Strong Performance: The East region also shows a significant sales quantity, suggesting a robust performance in that area. This region might benefit from similar factors as the North, or there may be region-specific products or preferences driving sales.
Lower Sales in the West: The West region has the lowest total sales quantity. This could indicate challenges such as lower brand awareness, fewer retail outlets, or regional preferences that differ from the company's offerings. Further analysis could explore reasons for the underperformance and identify opportunities for improvement.
'''
# Pie Chart: Distribution of Total Sales by Region
'''North Region's Major Share: The pie chart confirms that the North region holds the largest share of total sales, highlighting its importance to the company's overall revenue. This region's dominance may justify prioritizing resources and marketing efforts here.
Balanced Contribution from East and South: The East and South regions contribute a significant portion of sales, albeit less than the North. These regions are still vital to the company's success and may offer growth opportunities if targeted effectively.
West Region's Smaller Share: The West region's smaller share aligns with the bar chart findings. The company may need to investigate regional market conditions, competition, and consumer behavior to understand the lower sales and consider tailored strategies to boost performance.
'''
# Line Chart: Trend of Average Prices Over Time
'''Fluctuating Prices: The line chart shows that average prices have fluctuated over time. This variability could be due to factors such as promotions, discounts, seasonal sales, or changes in product offerings. Understanding the drivers behind these fluctuations can help in pricing strategy optimization.
Identifying Patterns: If there are noticeable patterns, such as regular spikes or dips, these could correspond to specific events (e.g., holiday sales, new product launches) or external factors (e.g., economic conditions). Recognizing these patterns can aid in better forecasting and planning.
Overall Trend: An overall upward or downward trend in prices can indicate changes in the market, such as increased costs of goods, inflation, or shifts in consumer purchasing power. Analyzing the underlying causes can provide insights into the company's pricing strategy and market positioning.
