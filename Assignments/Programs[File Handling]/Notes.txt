The ocean breeze whispered 
secrets through the swaying palm trees,
sending chills down Amelia's exposed arms.
Seagulls cried overhead,
their calls echoing off the rocky cliffs. 
Below, the turquoise water shimmered
like a 
million 
scattered jewels,
inviting her for a swim.
Hunger pangs grumbled
in her stomach,
reminding her of the picnic
basket overflowing with delicious treats.
